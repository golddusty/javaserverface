    <h1>JavaServer Faces Examples Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      From time to time, I update the examples based on reader feedback
      about bugs. It's my intention to <i>only</i> update the examples
      when they do not follow the specifications, as opposed to add
      work-arounds for specification-compliance bugs in various
      JSF implementations or web containers, with the possible exception
      for bugs in the JSF RI. For JSF implementation and container bugs,
      I instead inform the vendor about the problem, in the hope that 
      these examples will have a positive impact on spec-compliance over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note!</b> The example JAR filenames include the version, i.e.,
      "1_0_2" for the 1.0.2 version. You must remove the old JAR files
      when you install the new ones, and restart the web container.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes in 1.0.2 compared to the 1.0.1 version</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The BarRenderer didn't respect the rule that when the <code>rows</code>
        property is set to zero, all rows must be rendered. This is fixed
        in 1.0.2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a bug in the XMLViewHandler where it didn't suppress template
        text as it should, and included the root cause when throwing
        exceptions during template file parsing/rendering.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes in 1.0.1 compared to the 1.0 version</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The custom ViewHandler examples failed when using Internet Explorer
        (at least with IE 5 and 6) due to a bug in the JSF RI implementation
        of the RenderKit createResponseWriter() method, which doesn't
        accept "*/*" or "text/*" as valid replacements for "text/html" in
        the content type list (which corresponds to the Accept request
        header). I've added a work-around for this bug in the 
        com.mycompany.jsf.pl.ClassViewHandler class and reported the
        bug to the JSF RI team.
      </li>
